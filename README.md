# C Programming - Exercises Session 02

## Pointers, Arrays and Memory Management

1. Implement a program with a main function and two other functions:
    * `power(int x, int y)` – should return “x to the power of y”, for instance
power(2,3)=8
    * `multiSwap` – should take three integer-parameters x, y and z. After a call to multiSwap, x should be equal to the old y, y should be equal to the old z and z should be equal to the old x. The return type of multiSwap should be void.

1. Write a function named `sum_arrays` that takes two arrays as parameters, totals the values in both arrays and returns the total. Test your function by making a program that calls it.

1. Write a function that takes two integer arrays as parameters, combines and sorts the values into a new array and returns that array. Make a program that calls your function and verifies the result.
